Introduction
============

It started by reading `jenkins-php.org`_. It gives a good outline of where to start
but doesn't go into setting up specific projects. For example, I use :doc:`symfony`
a lot, so I decided to start adapting the template for use with :doc:`symfony`
projects. Then it turned into :doc:`magento` and :doc:`wordpress` projects.

The goal of this project is to provide infomation about setting up a job in jenkins
for one of those specific projects.
